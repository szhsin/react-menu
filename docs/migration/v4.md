# Migrating to v4

React-Menu v4.0.0 has reduced its package bundle size by around 10%. It's also shipped with a few API optimisations which introduced BREAKING changes as below:

## The new `gap` and `shift` props

These two props on menu components have replaced the old `offsetX` and `offsetY` props. When adjusting a menu's position relating to its anchor element, the new props will take into account the menu's placing direction.

Let's say you want to create a 10-pixel gap between a menu and its anchor, you had to apply either `offsetX` or `offsetY` based on directions of the menu:

```jsx
<Menu
  offsetX={direction === 'left' || direction === 'right' ? 10 : 0}
  offsetY={direction === 'top' || direction === 'bottom' ? 10 : 0}
/>
```

Using the new props, you can simply specify the gap value:

```jsx
<Menu gap={10} />
```

The same benefit applies to the `shift` prop.

## The new `arrowProps` prop

This new prop on menu components have replaced the old `arrowClassName` and `arrowStyle` props. `arrowProps` can be used to pass any attributes or events onto the arrow element of a menu.

If you have used the old props to apply styling to arrow elements as below:

```jsx
<Menu
  arrowClassName="my-custom-arrow"
  arrowStyle={{ backgroundColor: 'blue' }}
/>
```

Using the new `arrowProps`, the updated code would be:

```jsx
<Menu
  arrowProps={{
    className: 'my-custom-arrow',
    style: { backgroundColor: 'blue' }
  }}
/>
```

## Dropping ES5 support

To align with most libraries within the React ecosystem, the package distribution files have been transpiled to target ES6+. If you still need to support older environments such as IE 11, you need to config your bundling process to transpile this package in node_modules into ES5 code. Here is [an example](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader#some-files-in-my-node_modules-are-not-transpiled-for-ie-11) for webpack/babel configuration.
